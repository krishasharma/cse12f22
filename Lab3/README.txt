Lab 3: ASCII-risks

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab a program is written with several nested loops to print variable-sized ASCII triangles and a sequence of embedded numbers. In addition, this lab will introduce you to several different syscalls to incorporate I/O into your program. The program will print out a pattern with numbers and stars (asterisks). It will first prompt the user for the height of the pattern. If the user enters an invalid input such as a negative number or zero, an error message will be printed and the user will be prompted again. For a valid input, the program should print an asterisk pattern using numbers and stars with a tab between each of them.
