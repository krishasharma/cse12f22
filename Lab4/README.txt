Lab 4: Functions and Graphics

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab a program is written which implements functions that perform some primitive graphics operations on a small simulated display. These functions will allow users to change the background color of the display, and “draw” horizontal and vertical lines on the display. To simulate a display, the memory-mapped bitmap graphics display tool included with MARS will be used.
